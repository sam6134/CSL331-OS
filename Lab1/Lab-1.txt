Lab Task -1 

Task : Write a C program to generate a set of N distinct random integers. N  is an input from the user.


LCG: Xn=(aXn-1+b) mod c

Rules:  X1=2, X2=(aX1+b) mod c, X3=(aX2+b) mod c

1. Own method: XOR + bit-shift/any other
2. LCG Method: Xn=(aXn-1+b) mod c
3. Lagged Fibonacci method: Xi=Xi-p*Xi-q  (p, q) are basically called lags

Criteria:
1. Numbers should not exhibit easily recognizable patterns. Some patterns are:
a. Falling within same range [0-10] or [0-100] or etc..
b. Having same number of digits
c. Having repetitions or large period
d. Should not blindly use rand() function. Should explain how they are generating the random numbers/strings.

Task :Write a C program to generate a set of N distinct random strings. 

Grading Criteria:
1. Characters must be printable on screen.
2. Should not repeat strings or characters too many times.

Task: Implement a stack that will store  Integers

Grading Criteria:
1. Show the basic operations: push, pop, display
2. Test for 5 to 10 integers.

Additional Useful Notes
Include a program that checks that the output really does consist of distinct values.
